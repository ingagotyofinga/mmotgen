# mmotgen
This project is aimed at building a multi-modal conditional generative model with an optimal transport (OT) framework.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `data/`: Contains scripts for data preprocessing and data loading.
- `models/`: Contains the script for defining the model architecture.
- `train/`: Contains the script for training the model.
- `evaluate/`: Contains the script for evaluating the model's performance.
- `inference/`: Contains the script for making predictions or performing inference.
- `utils/`: Contains utility scripts and helper functions.
- `visualization/`: Contains the script for data visualization.
- `experiment/`: Contains the script for experiment tracking and configuration.

In addition, the project includes the following files:

- `config.py`: Configuration settings or parameters for the project.
- `main.py`: The entry point of the project.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/ingagotyofinga/mmotgen.git

2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Set up your data:

- Place your data files in the appropriate directory (`data/`) and update the data preprocessing script (`preprocess_data.py`) accordingly.

4. Run the project:

- Modify the configuration in `config.py` as needed.
- Execute `main.py` to start the project.
